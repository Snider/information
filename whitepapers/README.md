# Web3 Technical Specification Whitepapers

This network iteration aims to assist home users and SMEs by giving access to simple, safe tools enabling growth to local economies vs global monopolies by giving access to the network's fundamental building blocks to community developers and network participants.

The term Web3 used today is wildly incorrect, inferring a radical change in content richness and usability. What we have is Web2 with exotic URIs in production using emerging technologies. 

Users' Experience has improved, and open-source developers have created exciting creations worldwide.

The papers describe a cooperative network whereby all parties assist in relaying anonymised, encrypted payloads and perform network operations, including collective governance. 

It enables only the jurisdictions of senders and receivers the to comply with local law enforcement due to the network's Confidential but not Private nature enabling an OSI-7 compatible network with data sovereignty enforced at the protocol level that has the potential to become the OSI-9 draft candidate.

The work described in this repo results from 14 years of considering different application methodologies, observing commercial usage and how technologies have changed, the funding parties' intent to create such frameworks, and the likely commercial iteration of computing for home users.

The author of this work goes by the name @Snider, derived from the Dutch surname for a Tailor, Snyder.
